Convert a text list of Fahrenheit temps to Celsius temps in the console window and to a text file 

Program reads a text file called FahrenheitTemperature.txt, which includes data on the average yearly temperature for different cities in degrees Fahrenheit. A space separates each city from its Fahrenheit temperature (integer). The cityâ€™s name should not include any spaces or special characters (the name should consist of only a single word).  

After reading the data from the file, the program converts each temperature to Celsius and writes to CelsiusTemperature.txt. The destination file includes the destination city and Celsius temperature with precision set to 2 decimal spaces.
